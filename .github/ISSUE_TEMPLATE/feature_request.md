### Pre-submission Checklist
- [ ] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenLake/Student_Database_COSA/issues) to ensure this feature has not already been requested.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
**Current Issue:** [Describe the pain point or limitation in the current application]

**Example:** "As an admin, it's time-consuming to manually export a list of students belonging to a specific club for reporting purposes. I have to filter and then copy-paste the data."

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**Solution:** [Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature]

**Example:** "Add a 'Export to CSV' button on the student list page. When a filter is active (e.g., filtering by a club), clicking this button should download a CSV file containing only the filtered students' data, including their name, ID, and club positions."

**Technical Notes (optional):** [API changes, database needs, third-party libraries, etc.]
