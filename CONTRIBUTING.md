## Code of Conduct

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment, all contributors are expected to follow these simple rules:

* **Be respectful:** Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are encouraged, but personal attacks are not.
* **Be considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing `[openlake@iitbhilai.ac.in]`. All reports will be kept confidential.

## I just have a question!

* Join our community chat on Discord: [https://discord.gg/hQFhv2t4](https://discord.gg/3wFjfeTuPu).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report.

Before submitting a bug report, please check the existing [issues](../../issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please **include as many details as possible**. Fill out the required template, which will help us resolve issues faster.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.
* **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting a crash**, include a crash report with a stack trace.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Student_Database_CoSA users.
* **Provide code examples, screenshots, or mockups** if applicable.


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` issues:

* **Good first issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

## Development Workflow

Here's a brief overview of the development workflow.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Clone your fork:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student_Database_COSA.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Please use a descriptive branch name like `feature/add-new-button` or `fix/login-bug`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Set up your development environment.** 
5.  **Make your changes** in the code.
6.  **Commit your changes** using a descriptive commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add a new button for user profiles"
    ```
7.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
8. **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    * Fill in the PR template with a clear title and description of your changes.
    * Reference any relevant issues in your PR description (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    * Wait for a maintainer to review your PR. We will do our best to provide feedback in a timely manner.
    * Make any necessary changes based on the feedback.

## Issue/PR labels

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation only changes
* `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
* `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature, code improvement without changing behaviour.
* `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example: `feat(api): add endpoint for user data`
